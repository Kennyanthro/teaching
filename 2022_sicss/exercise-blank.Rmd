<!-- (task 1) add "very cool" to title, add author, and add your institution in date -->

<!-- (task 2) knit to PDF, then knit to HTML -->

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Introduction

<!-- (task 3) Add a sentence that includes an emphasis and a reference (in parentheses) to Wallis-Wallis_2015 -->

# Results

<!-- (task 4) calculate the number of rows in the dataset cars and save as object -->

```{r cars-descriptives}
# this is a code chunk
num_rows <- nrow(cars)
```

<!-- (task 5) Report the number of rows in a sentence -->

<!-- (task 6) Calculate and report the average speed (in mph) of the cars -->

```{r cars-calcs}
# what's the average speed (mph)?
```


<!-- (task 7) Plot speed against distance (extension: add a regression line) -->
<!-- (task 8) Add caption -->
<!-- (task 9) Hide any messages (hint: it's code chunk option) -->

```{r cars-plot}
## here's a plot with a fitted regression line
```

<!-- (task 10) Print a table of the first five rows of the cars dataset, and include a caption (hint: use kable from knitr) -->

```{r cars-table}
## make table

```

# Discussion

<!-- (task 11) the `bookdown` package helps with cross-referencing, so change output in YAML to "bookdown::pdf_document2"
<!-- (task 12) write a sentence that cross references both results section, the figure, and the table -->

<!-- Additional tasks: 

- Think of a recent paper you like: find a citation for it online, add it to the bib file, and reference it in the text above.

- Change the citation style (hint: use "csl: apa.csl" in YAML; what do you notice?)

- Add an image of a car
# knitr::include_graphics("car-picture.jpg")

- Adjust the directory structure, and the relevant commands, so that i) "car-picture.jpg" is in a separate "figures" folder and ii) "references.bib" is in a separate "references" folder.

- Check out: citr, pandoc, papaja, and see if you can make fancier adjustments to your file
